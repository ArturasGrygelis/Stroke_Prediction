Stroke Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on various health and demographic factors. The primary focus is on optimizing the recall metric to minimize false negatives, ensuring that individuals at high risk of stroke are not incorrectly classified as low-risk. The solution leverages a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) classifier, achieving a recall of 0.964 on test data.

Objective
The goal is to create a reliable predictive model using the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle. By prioritizing recall, the model is designed to support early intervention and reduce the risk of overlooking critical cases.

Key Features
Input Features: Age, BMI, average glucose levels, work type, smoking status, gender, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, and residence type.
Target Variable: Stroke occurrence (binary: 0 for no stroke, 1 for stroke).
Model: LightGBM Classifier, tuned for high recall.
Performance: Achieves a recall of 0.964 on the test dataset, indicating strong performance in identifying stroke cases.

Usage
The project includes a Streamlit-based web interface (app.py) for stroke probability prediction and visualization.
Select the "Stroke Prediction" dashboard to input patient data (e.g., age, BMI, smoking status) and receive a probability score along with SHAP-based feature impact analysis.
The "Model Information" dashboard provides insights into the LightGBM modelâ€™s decision tree and feature importance.
Model Artifacts
Trained Model: Saved as lgb1_model.pkl using pickle.
Encoder: Saved as encoder.joblib for categorical feature transformation.
Feature Lists: Saved as categorical_features.joblib and features.joblib.
Results
The LightGBM model effectively predicts stroke risk, with the following key findings:

Recall: 0.964 on test data, ensuring high sensitivity to stroke cases.
Important Features: Age, BMI, average glucose levels, work type, and smoking status are the most influential predictors.
Potential Improvements
Data Collection: Gather additional data with more diverse or novel features to enhance model robustness.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Explore a broader range of hyperparameters to further optimize performance.
Feature Engineering: Experiment with models excluding certain features to assess their individual impact.
